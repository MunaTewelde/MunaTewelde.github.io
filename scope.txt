1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
 x = 1;
    var a = 5;
    var b = 10;
     var c = function(a, b, c) {
          var x = 10;
          document.write(x);
          document.write(a);
          var f = function(a, b, c) {
               b = a;document.write(b);
                b = c;
                 var x = 5;
                  }
                   f(a,b,c);
                    document.write(b);
                    }
                    c(8,9,10);
                    document.write(b);
                     document.write(x);
                      }
                      Ans:10,8,8,9,10,1
                      
2. 
What is the difference between a method and function?
Ans:Method is written inside a class but function is not. In JavaScript function can be passed as parameter but a method can not passed as parameter

3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?
Ans:this keywordrefersto the current object in amethodor constructor.
4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?
Ans:“this”Refersto an Invoker Objectand unlike java it is mandatory
5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
 Ans:The keyword this inside the constructor function points to the newly created object. 
6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'. When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?
Ans:It refers to the object of x.
7. What is a free variable in JavaScript? Ans:A variable declared inside a function and there are not parameter and a local variable.
8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.Ans:Var a={name:”fred”,
Major:”music”,Property:finction(a,b){if(a< b){Return a;}else if(a===b){Return a*b;}Return b;}}9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function. Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position. 
Ans:
Var Employee = function(name, salary, position) {
    hhis.name = name;
    this.salary = salary;
    this.position = position;
    }
    var emp1 = new Employee(“bob”,8900,”Manager”);
    var emp2 = new Employee(“smith”,3000,”Accountant”)
    var emp3 = new Employee(“carl”,5000,”Supervisor ”)
10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the arguments. 
Ans:
function Mult(){
    var products=1;
    for(let I=0;i<arguments.length;i++){
        Products *=arguments[i]
}
return products;
}
11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.
Ans:
Function max(a,b,c){
    var maxnumber = (a, b,c) => {
        var i;
         var max = -Infinity;
         for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) { 
             if (arguments[i] > max) { 
                 max = arguments[i];
                 } 
                 } 
                 return max; }
